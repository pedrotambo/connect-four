DB -> Key value in file system -> in future replace for real db



WebSockets vs SSE
Both could work because allow server pushes, but WebSocketse it's also bidirectional
But as we are not doing client pushes, SSEs fits better because comes with advantages like:
- automatic reconnection
- event IDs

Also websocketes might be complex, SSEs is simpler but isn't extensible.


We could use bidirectionally websockets.
However, when you need to scale your solution you will want to separate writes from reads, and if you are doing everything through the same websocket, it will be not possible


WebSockets worse for cellphones because they need to maintain connection
WebSockets better for horizontal scale because you can put a "event bus?" or is the same for SSE

react-query gives you free polling so i discharged websockets.



Might want to use sockets as this game is not a chat where is constant communication.
A player might be some minutes thinking and we wouldn't want to waste resources quering every 5 seconds.
